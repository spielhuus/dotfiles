        This event is sent immediately when the object is created so that a

        This event indicates that the output power management mode control
        is no longer valid. This can happen for a number of reasons,
        including:
        - The output is capable of changing power management modes, but
          this client is not allowed to change it.
        - The output is no longer capable of changing power management
          modes.

        The client should exit or look for other power management modes
        controls.
